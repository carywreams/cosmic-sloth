An Arduino Exchange Point with My Nephew and Others...

We are starting with the [Elegoo EL-KIT-003 UNO Project Super Starter Kit with Tutorial for Arduino](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D8KOZF4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

I exchanged e-mail with Elegoo Support and received permission to repost their cotent here. 
That should take care of any DMCA concerns. Raw email may be found in the Wiki for this repo.
